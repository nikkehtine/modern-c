# Modern C

My attempt to write safe C code.

Usage of this library is disencouraged as it's still in development, and therefore
not tested extensively.

Even then you should consider using something more sane like **Rust**, **Go**, **Zig**
or **Odin** instead of trying to duct tape modern features into this C-nile language.
Let the elderly enjoy their retirement.

## Notes

In the future I will add macros for convenience. Now I just want to focus on the logic.
